WEATHER DESCRIPTION SOURCES SUMMARY
================================================================================

This script processes weather descriptions from TWO main sources:

SOURCE 1: DEDICATED WEATHER STAGING TABLES
- Table: Staging_Weather_Description  
- Structure: City columns with weather condition values
- Processing: UNPIVOT operation to normalize data structure
- Text Formatting: Title case (UPPER first letter + LOWER remainder)
- Use Case: Systematic weather monitoring data by city
- Example Output: 'Partly cloudy', 'Clear', 'Rain'

SOURCE 2: ACCIDENT STAGING TABLE  
- Table: Staging_Accident
- Field: weather_condition
- Structure: One record per accident with weather at incident time/location
- Processing: Direct field extraction with formatting
- Text Formatting: Title case (UPPER first letter + LOWER remainder)  
- Use Case: Weather conditions during specific traffic incidents
- Example Output: 'Clear' (from 'CLEAR'), 'Rain' (from 'RAIN')

INTEGRATION STRATEGY:
- Source 1: Use for general weather trends and city-wide analysis
- Source 2: Use for incident-specific weather correlation analysis
- Both sources apply consistent title case formatting for standardization
- Weather descriptions can be used interchangeably in downstream fact tables

BUSINESS VALUE:
- Enables weather impact analysis on traffic patterns
- Supports accident investigation with weather context
- Provides comprehensive weather coverage from multiple data sources
